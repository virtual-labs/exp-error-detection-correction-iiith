The aim of this experiment is to introduce students with standard array and syndrome decoding of linear block codes when the noise is introduced by the binary symmetric channel. Students will first learn how to construct a standard array corresponding to the given code and then use it to decode the given received vector. We will also introduce syndrome decoding method which is a simplified version of the standard array decoding. Through this experiment, students will be able to identify the set of error patterns that the given code is able to correct.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:

- Standard array construction
- Standard array decoding
- Syndrome decoding
