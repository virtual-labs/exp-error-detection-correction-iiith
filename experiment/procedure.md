### Procedure

There are three tasks in this experiment.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Standard Array Construction:**
* Enter the coset leader in the first field and click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The correctness of the entered coset leader is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* If the answer is correct, the corresponding row in the standard array table gets filled.
* Proceed to the next row and repeat the same procedure for the next coset leader.
* You can enter the coset leader in a field only if the coset leader in the previous row has been entered correctly. Once you have entered all the coset leaders correctly, the standard array table will be complete.
* <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example.
* <b>Previous</b> - Displays the previous example.
* <b>Reset</b> - Resets the standard array table.
