### Procedure

There are three tasks in this experiment.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Standard Array Construction:**
* In standard array construction, we divide all possible 2<sup>n</sup> vectors into 2<sup>k</sup> disjoint subsets such that there is exactly one codeword in each subset.
* For completing the j<sup>th</sup> row, identify a vector of minimum weight that has not appeared in the rows 1 to j-1. That vector is chosen as the coset leader.
* The remaining entries in the j<sup>th</sup> row are obtained by adding the coset leader to the codeword corresponding to each column.

**Procedure for Standard Array Decoding:**
* Enter the values in both the fields and click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example. Solve sufficient number of examples.

**Procedure for Syndrome Decoding:**
* Enter the values in both the fields and click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example. Solve sufficient number of examples.
