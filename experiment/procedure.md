There are three tasks in this experiment.
<br>

**Procedure for Standard Array Construction:**

1. Enter the coset leader in the first field and click on <b>Submit</b>.
2. The correctness of the entered coset leader is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
3. If the answer is correct, the corresponding row in the standard array table gets filled.
4. Proceed to the next row and repeat the same procedure for the next coset leader.
5. You can enter the coset leader in a field only if the coset leader in the previous row has been entered correctly. Once you have entered all the coset leaders correctly, the standard array table will be complete.
6. <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example.
7. <b>Previous</b> - Displays the previous example.
8. <b>Reset</b> - Resets the standard array table.
